# log-analysis-tool

#This project focuses on analyzing Linux authentication logs to identify suspicious login behavior and potential brute-force attacks. Using native Linux tools and Python scripting, the project simulates basic SOC-style monitoring and alert investigation.

#The goal is to demonstrate practical experience with Linux security, log analysis, and threat detection fundamentals.

#Operating System: Ubuntu Linux

#Languages: Python

#Linux Utilities: grep, awk, cut, sort, uniq

#Logs Analyzed: /var/log/auth.log

#How to run it: Go to the project's directory and use the command <python3 log_analyzer.py>. It will return an output within the shell and save the output into suspicious_activity_report.txt

#Example Output: No suspicious authentication activity detected.
